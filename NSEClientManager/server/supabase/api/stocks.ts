/**
 * Stock API Endpoints
 * 
 * This file will contain API handlers for stock-related operations:
 * 
 * Endpoints to implement:

 * - GET /api/stocks/top-performers - Get top performing stocks
 * - GET /api/stocks/:symbol - Get detailed stock information with results
 * - GET /api/stocks/search - Search stocks by symbol or name
 * 
 * Each endpoint should:
 * - Validate user authentication
 * - Check subscription status
 * - Query database efficiently
 * - Return formatted JSON response
 * - Handle errors appropriately
 * 
 * Implementation pending - to be completed in VS Code
